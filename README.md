# CDMA Encoder/Decoder

This project is a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) encoder and decoder. CDMA is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies. This project aims to provide a simple implementation of CDMA encoding and decoding techniques.

## Description

The CDMA Encoder/Decoder project includes:
- A CDMA encoder that converts input data into a CDMA signal.
- A CDMA decoder that retrieves the original data from the CDMA signal.
- Example scripts to demonstrate the encoding and decoding process.
